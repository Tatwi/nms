# My NMS Balance Adjustments

Most of these adjustments apply to all modes of the game, but I am speficically focusing on changes to **Survival Mode**, because the game play experience in that mode is more of what I expected from the game. Generally speaking, all of these changes make the game "harder", but more fun *for me*. However, there may be some changes that add a greater purpose to an item or that lessen the tedium of something and one might consider those changes to be "easier", I suppose. Anyway, the overarching concept here is to have the game play experience meet *my* expectations.    

## More Danger in Normal Mode
- Doubled energy discharge rate (still lower than Survival Mode).
- Hazard damage and underground recharge rate same as Survival Mode.
- Makes my "normal saves" more interesting for me.

## Freighter Nerf
- Can't magically transfer items to it from anywhere.
- Hyperdrive upgrades required to travel to different colored stars.

## Ship Inventory/Tech/Prices
- Storage and tech slots are based on the role of the ship type, rather than size.
- Normalized ship prices. It's based only on units/inventory slot cost, so I made Haulers more expensive than the rest. All ships are considerably more expensive than default.
- Normalized ship stats based on a max bonus budget of 15%/30%/60%/120% for C/B/A/S class to spread between the three stats (Damage/Shield/Hyperdrive). Generally, this was a buff to Shuttles, a small nerf to C/B/A classes (with the exception of Explorers), and buff to S classes.

## Multi-Tool Nerf
- Tech Slots 5-15 for all types. Too many slots is just crazy over powered and having fewer slots than something else makes that tool simply undesirable.
- Stat based roles more clearly defined.

## Item Balance
- **Ion Battery and Advanced Ion Battery:** Increased stack size so that there is actually a benefit of using them to recharge, because it was many times more effective (and cheaper!) to just use stacks of plain resources in the High Capacity Inventory slots. Now it's slightly better to use the batteries. Even with this higher stack size (which allows for more charges per inventory slot), one is likely to have the charging resoures anyway, because they are needed to repair broken tech, etc. Anyway, it bugged me, so I did this!
- **Life Support Gel:** Same idea as with the batteries. Slightly more effective than a stack of 500 Oxygen.
- **Oxygen Capsule:** Same idea as with the batteries. Slightly more effective than a stack of 500 Dioxite.

## ToDo
- Cause Sentinels in space to disengage (after 3 waves or after the player flees for 30 seconds).
