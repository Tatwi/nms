# My NMS Balance Adjustments

Most of these adjustments apply to all modes of the game, but I am speficically focusing on changes to **Survival Mode**, because the game play experience in that mode is more of what I expected from the game. Generally speaking, all of these changes make the game "harder", but more fun *for me*. However, there may be some changes that add a greater purpose to an item or that lessen the tedium of something and one might consider those changes to be "easier", I suppose. Anyway, the overarching concept here is to have the game play experience meet *my* expectations.    

## More Danger in Normal Mode
- Doubled energy discharge rate (still lower than Survival Mode).
- Hazard damage and underground recharge rate same as Survival Mode.
- Makes my "normal saves" more interesting for me.

## Freighter Nerf
- Can't magically transfer items to it from anywhere.
- Hyperdrive upgrades required to travel to different colored stars.

## Ship Inventory/Tech/Prices
- Storage and tech slots are based on the role of the ship type, rather than size.
- Stat bonuses were already OK except with Haulers, because shield bonuses are pointless due to being able to run away 100% of the time. As such, I gave a small bump to their hyperdive bonus.
- Normalized ship prices based on Hauler's max units/inventory slot cost and the Fighter's class multiplier values. Low end Haulers are more expensive, because they always have the largest inventory and all other ships are way more expensive too!

#### Fighter
- Inventory 15-20
- Tech 5-12

#### Shuttle
- Inventory 20-33
- Tech 3-8

#### Explorer
- Inventory 15-28
- Tech 5-12

#### Hauler
- Inventory 36-48
- Tech 2-4

#### Exotic
- Unchanged

#### Freighter
- Unchanged

## Multi-Tool Nerf
- Tech Slots 5-15 for all types. Too many slots is just crazy over powered and having fewer slots than something else makes that tool simply undesirable.
- Stat based roles more clearly defined.

- Mining C:2-8, B:8-10, A:10-20, S:20-25

## ToDo
